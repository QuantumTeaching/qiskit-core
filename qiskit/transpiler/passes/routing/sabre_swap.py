class SabreSwap(TransformationPass):
    r"""Map input circuit onto a backend topology via insertion of SWAPs.

    Implementation of the SWAP-based heuristic search from the SABRE qubit
    mapping paper [1] (Algorithm 1). The heuristic aims to minimize the number
    of lossy SWAPs inserted and the depth of the circuit.

    This algorithm starts from an initial layout of virtual qubits onto physical
    qubits, and iterates over the circuit DAG until all gates are exhausted,
    inserting SWAPs along the way. It only considers 2-qubit gates as only those
    are germane for the mapping problem (it is assumed that 3+ qubit gates are
    already decomposed).

    In each iteration, it will first check if there are any gates in the
    ``front_layer`` that can be directly applied. If so, it will apply them and
    remove them from ``front_layer``, and replenish that layer with new gates
    if possible. Otherwise, it will try to search for SWAPs, insert the SWAPs,
    and update the mapping.

    The search for SWAPs is restricted, in the sense that we only consider
    physical qubits in the neighborhood of those qubits involved in
    ``front_layer``. These give rise to a ``swap_candidate_list`` which is
    scored according to some heuristic cost function. The best SWAP is
    implemented and ``current_layout`` updated.

        Args:
            coupling_map (CouplingMap): CouplingMap of the target backend.
            heuristic (str): The type of heuristic to use when deciding best
                swap strategy ('basic' or 'lookahead' or 'decay').
            seed (int): random seed used to tie-break among candidate swaps.
            fake_run (bool): if true, it only pretend to do routing, i.e., no
                swap is effectively added.

        Additional Information:

            The search space of possible SWAPs on physical qubits is explored
            by assigning a score to the layout that would result from each SWAP.
            The goodness of a layout is evaluated based on how viable it makes
            the remaining virtual gates that must be applied. A few heuristic
            cost functions are supported

            - 'basic':

            The sum of distances for corresponding physical qubits of
            interacting virtual qubits in the front_layer.

            .. math::

                H_{basic} = \sum_{gate \in F} D[\pi(gate.q_1)][\pi(gate.q2)]

            - 'lookahead':

            This is the sum of two costs: first is the same as the basic cost.
            Second is the basic cost but now evaluated for the
            extended set as well (i.e. :math:`|E|` number of upcoming successors to gates in
            front_layer F). This is weighted by some amount EXTENDED_SET_WEIGHT (W) to
            signify that upcoming gates are less important that the front_layer.

            .. math::

                H_{decay}=\frac{1}{\left|{F}\right|}\sum_{gate \in F} D[\pi(gate.q_1)][\pi(gate.q2)]
                    + W*\frac{1}{\left|{E}\right|} \sum_{gate \in E} D[\pi(gate.q_1)][\pi(gate.q2)]

            - 'decay':

            This is the same as 'lookahead', but the whole cost is multiplied by a
            decay factor. This increases the cost if the SWAP that generated the
            trial layout was recently used (i.e. it penalizes increase in depth).

            .. math::

                H_{decay} = max(decay(SWAP.q_1), decay(SWAP.q_2)) {
                    \frac{1}{\left|{F}\right|} \sum_{gate \in F} D[\pi(gate.q_1)][\pi(gate.q2)]\\
                    + W *\frac{1}{\left|{E}\right|} \sum_{gate \in E} D[\pi(gate.q_1)][\pi(gate.q2)]
