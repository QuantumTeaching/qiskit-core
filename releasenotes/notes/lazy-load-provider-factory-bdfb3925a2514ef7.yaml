upgrade:
  - |
    The ``qiskit.Aer`` and ``qiskit.IBMQ`` top level attributes are now lazy
    loaded. This means that the objects will always now exist and warnings will
    no longer be raised on import if ``qiskit-aer`` or ``qiskit-ibmq-provider``
    are not installed (or can't be found by Python). If you were checking for
    the presence of ``qiskit-aer`` or ``qiskit-ibmq-provider`` using these
    module attributes and explicitly comparing to ``None`` or looking for the
    absence of the attribute this no longer will work because they are always
    defined as an object now.  You can either explicitly use
    ``qiskit.providers.aer.Aer`` and ``qiskit.providers.ibmq.IBMQ`` or
    check ``bool(qiskit.Aer)`` and ``bool(qiskit.IBMQ)`` instead to determine
    if those providers are present. This change was necessary to avoid potential
    import cycle issues between the qiskit packages and also to improve the
    import time when Aer or IBMQ is not being used.
  - |
    The user config file option ``suppress_packaging_warnings`` option in the
    user config file and the ``QISKIT_SUPPRESS_PACKAGING_WARNINGS`` environment
    variable no longer has any effect and will be silently ignored. These
    warnings have been removed and will no longer be emitted at import time
    from the qiskit module.
